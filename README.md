# loam_odometry

loam_odometry is an advanced implementation of **LOAM** and **ALOAM**, it also mainly refer the preprocessor of **Lego-Loam**,such as the segmentation and outlier removement of the each scan.

the original author(zhangji„ÄÅqintong and Tixiaoshan etc) deserves all credits and respects, I just improve the software engineering practices to make the code more readable and efficient. 
the purpose of loam_odometry is as below:
1. to improve the quality of the code.
2. to convert a multi-process application into a single-process / multi-threading one; this makes the algorithm more deterministic and slightly faster.
3. to remove hard-coded values and use `yaml` configuration files to set the parameters.
4. to improve performance, in terms of amount of CPU used to implement the same result.
## dependency
